# LA Food Policy Council Dashboard

In order to provide relevant and reliable data to these organizations, to policy-makers, and to members of the community, LAFPC needs a **dashboard** that displays this data in a digestible way that can be used by these oranizations and individuals to effect change in their communities and to work toward LAFPC's **Mission**, "to ensure food is healthy, affordable, fair and sustainable for all."
